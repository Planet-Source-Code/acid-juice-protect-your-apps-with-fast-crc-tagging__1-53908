## Protect your Apps with FAST\-CRC Tagging


</div>

### Description

Very simple example on CRC checks on file. Program allows to add patching protection to an executable file. It consists of two different projects: the APPLY project which is a program that computes the CRC and adds a tag to the main file you want to protect, and the MAIN project which is the file that is to be protected. This code combines the wonderful fast CRC-computation class of Fredrik Qvarfort with the original idea of Detonate (which unfortunately is just too slow on files over 1MB), so please give them all the credits. this is just a simple implementation.
